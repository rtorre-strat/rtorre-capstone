## Benefits of Individual Development

### For Learning
- âœ… Everyone experiences the full development lifecycle
- âœ… Complete ownership and responsibility
- âœ… Full portfolio project for job applications
- âœ… Experience with all parts of the tech stack
- âœ… Problem-solving skills across all domains

### For Collaboration
- âœ… Learn from 7 different approaches to the same problems
- âœ… Rich discussions comparing implementation strategies
- âœ… Help each other without dependency bottlenecks
- âœ… Build communication and mentoring skills
- âœ… Create a supportive learning environment

This approach ensures everyone gets the complete learning experience while maintaining the collaborative spirit of the internship program!
