# Individual Project Development - Parallel Implementations

## Overview

Each intern will build their own complete version of the project management tool. This ensures everyone gets the full learning experience across all aspects of full-stack development, from setup to deployment.

## Individual Development Approach

### Why Individual Projects?
- **Fair Learning**: Everyone experiences all aspects of development
- **Complete Ownership**: Each intern owns their entire codebase
- **Portfolio Building**: Each intern has a complete project for their portfolio
- **Comprehensive Skills**: No one misses out on any part of the stack
- **Individual Pacing**: Interns can work at their own pace while following milestones

### Project Setup - Individual Forks
Each intern should fork the project repository individually:

#### How to Fork and Set Up Your Project

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Go to the main repository on GitHub
   # Click "Fork" to create your own copy
   # Clone your fork locally
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nextjs-internship-capstone.git
   cd nextjs-internship-capstone/project
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install

   # Start development server
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Create Your Own Implementation**
   - Work on your fork independently
   - Build the complete project from start to finish
   - Own your entire codebase and learning journey

## Task Tracking & Progress Management

### Recommended Task Tracking Methods

#### Option 1: GitHub Issues in Your Fork (Recommended)
Create issues in your forked repository to track your progress:

**Issue Template:**
```markdown
## Task: [Phase] - [Feature Name]
**Priority**: High/Medium/Low
**Estimated Time**: X hours
**Week**: Week X

### Description
Clear description of what needs to be implemented.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific, measurable criteria
- [ ] That define when the task is complete
- [ ] Include testing requirements

### Notes
- Dependencies on other tasks
- Useful resources or documentation links
- Implementation notes or constraints
```

#### Option 2: Personal GitHub Projects Board
Set up a project board in your fork with these columns:
- **üìã Backlog** - All planned tasks
- **üéØ Current Sprint** - Tasks for this week
- **üë®‚Äçüíª In Progress** - Currently working on
- **üëÄ Review** - Self-review and testing
- **‚úÖ Done** - Completed tasks

#### Option 3: External Task Management Tools
- **Notion**: Create a personal project dashboard with databases
- **Trello**: Simple Kanban board for visual task management
- **Linear**: Advanced project management with time tracking
- **Todoist**: Simple task list with due dates and priorities

### Task Categories & Labels
Organize your tasks using these categories:
- `setup` - Project initialization and configuration
- `auth` - Authentication and user management
- `database` - Database schema and operations
- `frontend` - UI components and pages
- `backend` - API routes and server logic
- `testing` - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
- `deployment` - Production deployment and CI/CD
- `documentation` - README, comments, and guides

### Priority Levels
- **High**: Blocking other tasks or critical functionality
- **Medium**: Important features for MVP
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features or optimizations

## Shared Learning & Collaboration

### Despite Individual Development, We Collaborate On:

#### 1. Knowledge Sharing
- **Daily Standups**: Share progress, blockers, solutions
- **Code Review Sessions**: Review each other's approaches
- **Technical Discussions**: Debate different implementation strategies
- **Pair Programming**: Optional pairing for difficult problems

#### 2. Standards & Conventions
- **Shared Documentation**: Common setup guides and best practices
- **Code Standards**: Same ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configs
- **Git Conventions**: Consistent commit messages and PR formats
- **Testing Standards**: Same testing frameworks and patterns

#### 3. Problem Solving
- **Blocked? Ask the Team**: Anyone can help anyone
- **Solution Sharing**: Share discoveries and breakthroughs
- **Code Reviews**: Optional cross-reviews for learning
- **Retrospectives**: Weekly reflection on what's working

## Git Workflow for Individual Forks

### Branch Strategy in Your Fork
Work directly on your fork with feature branches:

```
your-fork/main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/auth-setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/database-schema
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/kanban-board
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fix/drag-drop-bug
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/setup-improvements
```

### Recommended Git Workflow
1. **Create feature branches** for each major task
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
   # Work on the feature
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication with Clerk"
   git push origin feature/user-authentication
   ```

2. **Merge to your main branch** when feature is complete
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/user-authentication
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Keep your fork updated** (optional - if you want updates from the original repo)
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-REPO/nextjs-internship-capstone.git
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

### Commit Message Conventions
Use conventional commits for better tracking:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation updates
- `style:` - Code formatting
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## Showcase & Comparison

### End of Project Showcase
Each intern will demo their individual implementation:

#### Individual Presentations (15 min each)
- **Demo**: Live demonstration of all features
- **Technical Deep Dive**: Explain interesting technical decisions
- **Challenges & Solutions**: Share biggest challenges and how they solved them

#### Group Discussion
- **Approach Comparison**: Compare different implementation strategies
- **Best Practices**: Identify patterns that worked well across projects
- **Learning Highlights**: Share biggest learning moments
