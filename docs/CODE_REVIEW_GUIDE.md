# Code Review & Collaboration Guide for Individual Development

## Overview

While each intern works on their own fork independently, code reviews remain valuable for learning and knowledge sharing. This guide outlines optional code review processes and collaboration best practices for individual development with peer learning.

## Individual Development with Optional Peer Review

### 1. Self-Review Process (Required)

Since you own your entire codebase, self-review becomes crucial:

#### Self-Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript and ESLint rules
- [ ] All tests pass locally (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Code is properly formatted (`pnpm lint:fix`)
- [ ] No console.log statements or debugging code
- [ ] Meaningful commit messages following convention
- [ ] Feature works as expected in browser
- [ ] Code is readable and well-documented

#### Code Quality Standards
- [ ] Functions are small and focused (single responsibility)
- [ ] Variables and functions have descriptive names
- [ ] Complex logic includes comments explaining the "why"
- [ ] Error handling is implemented where appropriate
- [ ] TypeScript types are properly defined (no `any`)

### 2. Optional Peer Review Process

#### When to Request Peer Review
- **Stuck on a problem**: Get help from other interns
- **Learning opportunity**: Share interesting solutions
- **Before major features**: Get feedback on architecture decisions
- **Complex implementations**: Validate approach with peers

#### How to Share Your Code for Review

**Option 1: Share Your Fork**
```bash
# Share your repository URL with other interns
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nextjs-internship-capstone
```

**Option 2: Create a Discussion Issue**
Create an issue in your fork with this template:
```markdown
## 🤔 Looking for Feedback: [Feature Name]

### What I'm working on
Brief description of the feature or problem.

### My approach
Explain your implementation approach.

### Specific questions
- How can I improve this code?
- Is there a better way to handle X?
- Any potential issues you see?

### Code to review
Link to specific files or commits:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Main dashboard component
- `lib/auth.ts` - Authentication logic

### How to test
1. Clone my fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nextjs-internship-capstone`
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Test the feature: [specific steps]
```

#### Peer Review Guidelines
- **Voluntary**: All peer reviews are optional and voluntary
- **Learning focused**: Focus on learning and knowledge sharing
- **Respectful**: Be constructive and supportive
- **No blocking**: Reviews don't block your progress

### 3. Knowledge Sharing & Learning

#### Sharing Your Solutions

##### When to Share
- **Breakthrough moments**: Solved a difficult problem
- **Interesting patterns**: Found a clever solution
- **Learning discoveries**: Learned something valuable
- **Common challenges**: Help others avoid similar issues

##### How to Share
- **Daily standups**: Share quick wins and solutions
- **Team chat**: Post code snippets and explanations
- **Documentation**: Update guides with new learnings
- **Demo sessions**: Show working features to the team

#### Learning from Others

##### Asking for Help
- **Be specific**: Describe exactly what you're trying to achieve
- **Share context**: Provide relevant code and error messages
- **Show attempts**: Explain what you've already tried
- **Ask questions**: Don't just ask for solutions, ask for understanding

#### For Reviewers

##### Review Focus Areas

**1. Functionality**
- Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- Are edge cases handled appropriately?
- Is error handling implemented correctly?

**2. Code Quality**
- Is the code readable and maintainable?
- Are functions and variables well-named?
- Is the code following project conventions?

**3. Performance**
- Are there any obvious performance issues?
- Is the code efficiently written?
- Are there unnecessary re-renders or computations?

**4. Security**
- Are user inputs properly validated?
- Are sensitive data and secrets handled correctly?
- Are authentication and authorization working properly?

**5. Testing**
- Are there appropriate tests for new functionality?
- Do tests cover edge cases and error scenarios?
- Are tests readable and maintainable?

##### Providing Feedback

**Use Constructive Language**
```
❌ "This is wrong"
✅ "Consider using useState here instead of useRef for this use case"

❌ "Bad variable name"
✅ "Could we use a more descriptive name like 'activeProjectId' instead of 'id'?"

❌ "This won't work"
✅ "This might cause issues when the user has no projects. Should we add a loading state?"
```

**Categories of Feedback**
- **Must Fix**: Critical issues that prevent merge
- **Should Fix**: Important improvements that should be addressed
- **Consider**: Suggestions for improvement (nice to have)
- **Question**: Asking for clarification or understanding

**Example Comments**
```
[MUST FIX] This will cause a runtime error if projects is undefined.
Add optional chaining: projects?.map()

[SHOULD FIX] Consider extracting this logic into a custom hook
for reusability across components.

[CONSIDER] We could use a more semantic HTML element here,
like <section> instead of <div>, for better accessibility.

[QUESTION] Why did you choose Zustand over React Context for this state?
I'm curious about the reasoning.
```

##### Review Response Times
- **Initial review**: Within 24 hours
- **Follow-up reviews**: Within 4-6 hours during work hours
- **Emergency fixes**: Within 2 hours

### 4. Common Code Review Patterns

#### Next.js Specific Reviews

**Server vs Client Components**
```typescript
// ❌ Unnecessary client component
'use client'
export function ProjectList({ projects }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {projects.map(project => <div key={project.id}>{project.name}</div>)}
    </div>
  )
}

// ✅ Server component is sufficient
export function ProjectList({ projects }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {projects.map(project => <div key={project.id}>{project.name}</div>)}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Server Actions Usage**
```typescript
// ❌ Missing error handling and validation
export async function createProject(name: string) {
  await db.insert(projects).values({ name })
  revalidatePath('/dashboard')
}

// ✅ Proper validation and error handling
export async function createProject(formData: FormData) {
  const name = formData.get('name') as string

  if (!name || name.trim().length < 3) {
    throw new Error('Project name must be at least 3 characters')
  }

  try {
    await db.insert(projects).values({
      name: name.trim(),
      userId: auth().userId
    })
    revalidatePath('/dashboard')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to create project:', error)
    throw new Error('Failed to create project')
  }
}
```

#### React Best Practices

**Proper Hooks Usage**
```typescript
// ❌ Hooks in conditional
function TaskCard({ task }) {
  if (!task) return null

  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false) // ❌ Hook after conditional
}

// ✅ Hooks at top level
function TaskCard({ task }) {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false) // ✅ Hook at top

  if (!task) return null
}
```

**Component Composition**
```typescript
// ❌ Prop drilling and tight coupling
function Dashboard({ user, projects, onCreateProject, onEditProject }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header user={user} />
      <ProjectList
        projects={projects}
        onCreateProject={onCreateProject}
        onEditProject={onEditProject}
        user={user}
      />
    </div>
  )
}

// ✅ Better composition and separation of concerns
function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <ProjectList />
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### TypeScript Standards

**Proper Type Definitions**
```typescript
// ❌ Using any or missing types
function updateTask(id, data) {
  // ...
}

// ✅ Proper typing
interface UpdateTaskData {
  title?: string
  description?: string
  status?: TaskStatus
}

function updateTask(id: string, data: UpdateTaskData): Promise<Task> {
  // ...
}
```

### 5. Review Tools and Automation

#### GitHub Features
- **Request reviews**: Always request review from at least one team member
- **Review comments**: Use line-by-line comments for specific feedback
- **Suggestions**: Use GitHub's suggestion feature for small fixes
- **Required reviews**: Main branch requires at least one approval

#### Automated Checks
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: All tests must pass before merge
- **Type checking**: TypeScript compilation must succeed
- **Linting**: ESLint rules must pass
- **Format checking**: Prettier formatting must be correct

### 6. Conflict Resolution

#### When Reviewers Disagree
1. **Discussion**: Have a respectful technical discussion
2. **Research**: Look up best practices and documentation
3. **Mentor input**: Escalate to mentor if needed
4. **Team decision**: Discuss in team meeting if necessary

#### When Reviews Are Delayed
1. **Gentle reminder**: Ping in team chat after 24 hours
2. **Request different reviewer**: If original reviewer is busy
3. **Escalate**: Bring to mentor's attention if blocking progress

### 7. Learning from Reviews

#### For Authors
- **Take notes**: Document feedback for future reference
- **Ask questions**: Understand the reasoning behind suggestions
- **Apply learnings**: Use feedback to improve future code
- **Share knowledge**: Help teammates avoid similar issues

#### For Reviewers
- **Learn from others**: See different approaches to problems
