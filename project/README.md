   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash

## 👥 Individual Development & Collaboration

### Project Setup
**Each intern should fork this repository individually** to create their own complete implementation:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Fork this repo on GitHub to your personal account
   # Clone your fork locally
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nextjs-internship-capstone.git
   cd nextjs-internship-capstone/project
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install

   # Start development
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Create Your Implementation**
   - Work on your own fork independently
   - Build the complete project from start to finish
   - Own your entire codebase and learning journey

## 🔧 Implementing Real Dependencies

As you progress through development, you'll need to replace placeholder dependencies with real ones:

### Steps to Clean Up Dependencies

1. **Remove placeholder dependencies** from `package.json`:
   ```bash
   # Remove the _comment and _todo_dependencies sections
   # These contain placeholder/mock dependencies
   ```

2. **Install real dependencies** as you implement features:
   ```bash
   # Example: When implementing authentication
   pnpm add @clerk/nextjs

   # Example: When implementing database
   pnpm add drizzle-orm drizzle-kit @vercel/postgres

   # Example: When implementing drag & drop
   pnpm add @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable

   # Example: When implementing state management
   pnpm add zustand

   # Example: When implementing form validation
   pnpm add zod
   ```

3. **Add development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Testing dependencies
   pnpm add -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom playwright

   # Additional dev tools as needed
   pnpm add -D @types/node
   ```

4. **Check for dependency conflicts**:
   ```bash
   # Check for warnings
   pnpm ls

   # Install missing peer dependencies if needed
   pnpm add <missing-peer-dependency>
   ```

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Authentication system with Clerk
- [ ] Database schema and ORM with Drizzle
- [ ] State management with Zustand
- [ ] Drag & drop functionality with @dnd-kit
- [ ] Form validation with Zod
- [ ] Testing setup with Jest and Playwright
- [ ] All placeholder components replaced with real functionality
- [ ] No more TODO comments in package.json

## 🚀 Next Steps for Development

1. **Set up Authentication**: Integrate Clerk for user management
2. **Database Integration**: Implement Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
3. **State Management**: Complete Zustand store implementations
4. **Core Features**: Build functional CRUD operations
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test suite
6. **Deployment**: Set up CI/CD pipeline with Vercel
